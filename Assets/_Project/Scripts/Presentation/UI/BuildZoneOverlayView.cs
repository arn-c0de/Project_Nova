    /// and no anchor list of its own, so when D-108 re-opens the anchor
    /// list the picture follows the simulation on its own instead of
    /// silently going stale. Terrain walkability and field spacing are
    /// deliberately NOT painted: field spacing is role-dependent (the
    /// Refinery inverts it) and the placement ghost already gives the full
    /// per-position verdict at the cursor. Texel (x, y) answers for a
    /// footprint origin at cell (x, y); the ghost's origin sits one cell
    /// south-west of the cursor cell, which is exactly the value the LMB
    /// click validates.
